You should see the two fixed points on the right collide and disappear, at which
point the trajectory again dramatically slides along the Cdh1 nullcline, and
falls into the S/G2/M state.

Notice how the solutions of the intersecting nullclines depend on the value of the mass.
In the next section, we will plot these possible solutions directly as a function
of increase mass.
