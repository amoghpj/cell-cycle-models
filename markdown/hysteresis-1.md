To get a better picture of how mass affects the 
steady states of the system, the plot below shows
the CycB steady states as a function of the combination
of parameters and mass below.

$p = (k3d + k3dd*A)/(k4*m)$

Notice that *p* decreases as *m* increases, while *p* increases
with the parameter *A*, which we haven't talked about yet.

The reverse S shape of this plot indicates the hysteresis
in CycB activity: immediately after mitosis, the cell lies
in the bottom right corner. As mass increases, the system
moves to the left, until the G1 state disappears, and the
cell zooms up to the S/G2/M state. 

Use the sliders below to first increase the mass to see the
first irreversible decision to S/G2/M
