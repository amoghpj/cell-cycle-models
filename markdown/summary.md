It is now nearly two decades after the perspective piece by Tyson and Novak 
was first published. The yeast cell cycle models have  have since been iteratively
refined and expanded. The work by Tyson and Novak has expanded our understanding
of this field, incorporating experimental observations meticulously into the model
building process to ensure that the model remains biologically meaningful. 

Below are some resources that might prove useful to anyone curious about the kind
of effort that goes into creating such mechanistic models in biology

1. For an exhaustive description of the molecular biology as well as a complete
   description of the first budding yeast cell cycle model, I highly recommend the 
   [page curated by Kathy Chen, from Tyson's group](http://mpf.biol.vt.edu/research/budding_yeast_model/pp/index.php)
2. [Barik et al, 2016](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005230)
   published a stochastic version of the cell cycle model
3. [Kraikivski et al, 2015](https://www.nature.com/articles/npjsba201516)
   published an extensive analysis 257 yeast cell cycle mutants, showing how the model
   successfully explains a whole host of experimental observations

Creating this site has been an exciting challenge for me. There is a lot of work
