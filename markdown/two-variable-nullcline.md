You will notice that there is a dramatic switch when mass hits a threshold,
 suddenly CycB shoots up, and Cdh1 goes down. At this point the cell has
committed to the S/G2/M phases, and is ready to divide. But since division
results in the *mass* of the cell dividing into its daughters, use the slider
to set *m* to a low value  again. Notice that the configurations of CycB and Cdh1
have flipped again.

The exercise above shows the effect of mass on the CycB-Cdh1
antagonism.  In order to get a sense of how this two-component system
behaves in general, the plot below shows the nullclines of this
system, that is, how Cdh1 (red) and CycB (blue) behave at steady
state. The intersection of these curves (green dots) indicate the
"fixed points" of the system, i.e. any trajectory will either be
attracted to, or repelled by these points. Initially, the system has
three "solutions": The one on the right is the G1 attractor. (It is an
attractor, becasue the trajectory (starting at high Cdh1, low CycB,
low mass) ends up falling into the green point). The one on the left
is the S/G2/M attractor. 

Use the sliders to increase the mass slowly, and observe the behavior of
the green dots, and the trajectory (dashed line). Is the fixed point in 
the middle an attractor or a repeller? What does the stability of this point
mean for the two other fixed points?
