The cell is now undergoing mitosis. In order for it to
complete division and return to the G1 branch, the cell has
to fall off S/G2/M branch on the right. For this to happen,
it has to travel along this branch on the top, going to the
right. How does this happen? The mystery variable *A* takes
care of this. It represents the separation of chromatids, and
progress through anaphase. In the next section, we will introduce
another variable to represent this process, which will drive
the cell through cell division, causing it to fall off the 
S/G2/M branch *irreversibly* back to G1. Test this for yourself
by selecting a high CycB, low Cdh1 initial condition, and watch the
cell fall back to G1.
