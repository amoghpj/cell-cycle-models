Notice that the cell-cycle oscillations completely vanish, and all the variables
go to steady state! Now, examine these values: Cdh1 is high, CycB is low, CKI is (very) high.
This looks like a cell in G1! We can then interpret, that the cell is in fact *arrested* in 
G1, since the CKI will have to be degraded in order for the cell to progress into S/G2/M.

If CKI is the agent responsible for this arrest, what would a *cln1 cln2* additionally lacking 
CKI look like? (This mutant would be represented by setting the parameters $k_{13}=0, K_{11}=0$).
Use the drop down menu to simulate this triple deletion strain.

... and voila! the cell cycle oscillations resume! Thus, this strain is not only
viable, it *rescues* the *cln1 cln2* G1 arrest phenotype!
