TLDR; This project seeks to make a series of abstract models of the
eukaryotic cell cycle accessble to non-modelers. The content is
organized as per the ideas developed in [Tyson and Novak,
2001](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11371178).  This interactive
site is meant to be an educational tool, aimed at anyone who has been
exposed to the basic concepts of eukaroytic mitosis, and is curious
about the utility of mathematical models in making sense of complex
biological processes.


## What are the cell cycle models all about?
All cells go through a cycle of events where they grow and divide:
when the cell judges that there is sufficient nutrition available in the
environment, it commits to duplicating its genome (S phase). Following 
a gap phase where the cell ensures that the DNA is not damaged(G2 phase),
the cell commits to dividing into two daughter cells. What follows is 
an intricate orchestra of cellular events: the genome is first condensed
into chromosomes, an elaborate microtubule spindle assembles around the nucleus,
which then pull apart the duplicated sister chromatids to the poles of the cell.
Finally, the entire cell divides, partitioning its organelles and cytoplasm
between its daughters. The daughter cell, at the end of mitosis, waits
to judge the environment, waiting in G1, waiting to commit to another cycle of growth
and division...

Underneath this clockwork of events lies a network of signals, molecular signals,
that act like semaphores, *committing* the cell to the next phase of the cell cycle.
How does this molecular network make these irreversible decisions? Tyson and Novak
explore this question in a series of mathematical models, adding molecular
complexity at each stage, investigating the origins of cellular decision making. 
Use the tabs on the left to explore them!

## Why did you make this?
The prototypical mathematical model of biological systems still seems
to be the Lotka-Volterra predator-prey model, from the 20th
century. The curious student with an interest in molecular biology
*may* have come across the
[reprissilator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repressilator).  I
believe that there is still a general lack of awareness of the success
of mathematical models of cellular processes, ranging from the cell
cycle, to circadian oscillations, to autophagy, and even dynamical
models of cancer.  While there are general purpose tools [Cell
Collective](https://cellcollective.org/#) that provide platforms to
lower the barrier to entry to these theoretical models, I have not
come across a curated, interactive resource exploring any of these
models in depth. This is my attempt at creating such a tool, focussed
on the highly successful work by Tyson and Novak in the last couple of
decades on the yeast cell cycle.
